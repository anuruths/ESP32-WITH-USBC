# ESP32 Custom Development Board | Altium Designer Project

This repository contains the complete hardware design files for a custom ESP32-based development board created using **Altium Designer**. The board is optimized for IoT prototyping, training in PCB design, and embedded system applications.

📌 Features

- ESP32-WROOM module with Wi-Fi + Bluetooth
- On-board USB-to-UART interface for programming and debugging
- 3.3 V regulated power supply with proper decoupling
- Reset and Boot buttons configured for flashing
- GPIO pin headers for easy expansion with sensors and modules
- Optimized RF clearance region for improved wireless performance
- Compact and beginner-friendly design for rapid prototyping


📁 Repository Structure

🔧 Manufacturing Information

Fabrication outputs include:
